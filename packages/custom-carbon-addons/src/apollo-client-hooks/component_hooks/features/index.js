// INSTRUCTIONS:
// Just add your exports for custom components list so
// (assuming you have features with matching directory names of 'MyFeature1' and 'MyFeature2'):

// Exporting (by uncommenting) these 2 features adds them to the 'CustomApolloClientHooks' list
// export { default as MyFeature1 } from './MyFeature1';
// export { default as MyFeature2 } from './MyFeature2';
