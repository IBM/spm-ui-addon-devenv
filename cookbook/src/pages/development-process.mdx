# Front-end development

Use the standard Social Program Management client development environment (CDEJ) to create a UIM page and then use the Add-on Development environment to populate your UIM page with React JavaScript components. For more information about React development, see the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md) documentation.

You can use React components directly from the IBM Carbon Design System or, if you can't find what you need, create your own Carbon Add-on components in React. A Carbon add-on is a custom component that conforms to the IBM Carbon Design System guidelines. 

Some example add-on components are provided in the repository. You can do your front-end development in parallel with your back-end development or in isolation.

## Getting started with Carbon React JS

The Carbon Design System provides design guidance for the development of user interface components based on the Carbon Design System and implemented in a number of frameworks, including React.

If you are new to Carbon and React development, see the [Carbon v10 React tutorial](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview/) to get you started.

For more information, see the [Carbon v10 website](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Carbon v10 Storybook](https://v10-react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/getting-started--welcome).
  
# Back-end development

Using the Social Program Management server development environment and GraphQL functionality, implement the services (business logic) to create/update/get the data for your components. GraphQL is recommended for the back-end data service, especially for data intensive screens, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql).
