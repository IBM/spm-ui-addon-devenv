 During development, first build your component, then run a development build to pick up any changes you make during development.
 
 When development is complete on your custom Carbon component, redeploy the component artifacts and place them under source control.

1. Build your component.

   ``` 
   npm run build
   ```

12. Run a development build to pick up any changes you make to the component.

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. To redeploy the component artifacts, run the following command to copy the generated compiled resources to your web client custom component.

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. Ensure that you place the component artifacts under source control.
5. Deploy the application EAR file as usual.
