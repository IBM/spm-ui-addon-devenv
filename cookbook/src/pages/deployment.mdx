When development is complete on your custom Carbon component, redeploy the component artifacts, place them under source control, and deploy the application EAR file.
For more information about commands, see the [Command reference](command-reference). 
 
1. Build your component.

   ``` 
   npm run build
   ```
2.  To redeploy the component artifacts, run the following command to copy the generated compiled resources to your web client custom component.

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```
3. Ensure that you place the component artifacts under source control.
4. Deploy the application EAR file as usual.
