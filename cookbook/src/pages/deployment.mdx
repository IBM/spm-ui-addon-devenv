Once development has been completed on new caron components andÂ  you are ready to deploy them to a test environment, there is nothing additional that needs to be done.

The only thing to note is that when the integation command is running e.g `npm run dev`. The generated compiled resources will be copied over to your custom component. You should put these resources under source control.
