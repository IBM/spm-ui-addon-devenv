Once development has been completed on new caron components andÂ  you are ready to deploy them to a test environment, there a command that need to be run to ensure that the compiled JavaScript is copied to the webclient custom component.
The command to be run is 'npm run deploy'.

The only thing to note is that when the integation command is running e.g `npm run dev`. The generated compiled resources will be copied over to your custom component. You should put these resources under source control.
