When development has been completed on new Carbon components andÂ you are ready to deploy them to a test environment, there is nothing additional that needs to be done.

The only thing to note is that when the integation command is running e.g `npm run dev`. The generated compiled resources are copied over to your custom component. Ensure that you place these resources under source control.
