## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

The SPM UI Addons Development Environment does not depend on a specific IDE, you can choose your own. There are many IDEs that you can choose, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime.
However, IBM uses Microsoft Visual Studio Code to develop Social Program Managment UI Addons, it supports many plugins that make development faster and easier, for example it supports the following tools:

* Linting tools (ESLint)
* Code formatters (Prettier)
* Debugging tools (Debugger for Chrome)
* Documentation tools (JSDoc)

IBM does not own, develop, or support these tools.

The repository includes some basic configuration for Microsoft Visual Studio Code and you can download more plug ins as necessary.  The IDE also has a terminal to run commands.

## Git

The open source software is hosted on GitHub so we recommend that you use Git for source control.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/): The [Github Guide to
  Installing Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) is a good source of information.
