title: Integrating the sample addon into UIM
description: Integrating the sample addon into UIM

Currently the only supported integration point of a Carbon component onto a UIM page is by using a Java renderer.
This procedure assumes that a custom UIM page with a configured Java renderer exists, which is available to host a Carbon component so that it can be integrated and displayed to the user.
For more information about configuring renderers, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=widgets-configuring-renderers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=widgets-configuring-renderers).

The `carbon-addon-devenv` package contains two sample addons. You can view the addons in Storybook by running the `npm` command to run Storybook.
However, you must complete some steps to test their integration with a UIM page.

1. Implement GraphQL to match the sample query. A GraphQL backend service is needed to provide the data access for the sample addons that are to be integrated into a UIM page.
    The GraphQL query can be implemented in Social Program Management. It must match the data expected in the queries that are currently written in order for the sample addons to display properyl when intergated in a SPM UIM page.
2. Reference the Sample Query Providers. The sample Query Providers which are available in the `apollo-client-hooks/index.sample` file. They just need to be referenced in a `index.js` file in this directory in order to be able to integrate them.
3. Reference the sample sass.
    In order to enable the look and feel for the sample components, the commented line within the scss/index.scss file need to be uncommented.
4. Build and integrate with renderer.
    When these steps are completed, the code needs to be built and integrated with UIM. The next step after that is to integrate the components with Java Renderer as described in the next section.
    The commands to build and integrate are describe in the previous development process section.
