Here's how to integrate a component with a UIM page with reference to the sample add-on components in the `carbon-addon-devenv` package.

1. Implement GraphQL to match the sample query. A GraphQL back-end service is needed to provide the data access for the sample components.
   For the components to display properly when integrated in a UIM page, You must implement a GraphQL query in Social Program Management.
   The query must match the data expected in the front-end queries of the sample components.
2. Reference the sample Sass. To enable the look and feel for the sample components,
   uncomment the commented line in the `scss/index.scss` file.
3. Build and integrate with the renderer.

   ```
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```
