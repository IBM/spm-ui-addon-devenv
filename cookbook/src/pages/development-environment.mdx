Among other files, the repository contains the following significant items. Depending on your operating system, you might need to show hidden files to see them all.

```

└───cookbook            The developer documentation. 
└───packages            The repository provides two packages.

# carbon-addon-devenv

The `carbon-addon-devenv` package contains the development environment to work with Carbon components and to develop custom Carbon add-on components. It contains two sample add-on components to help you to get started, which need a Java renderer and a GraphQL query to integrate them onto a UIM page. 

```

└───sample_renderers
└───src
└───stories
    PersonFolio.stories.js
```

An `npm` file is provided for the following open source packages:

- Carbon Design System, which is the IBM  open source design system. It consists of working code, design tools and resources, and human interface guidelines. For more information, see the [Carbon v10 website](https://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/).
- React, which is an open source JavaScript library that enables developers to build human-centered user interfaces.
- GraphQL, which is an open source data query language that enables developers to query and configure complex data queries that aggregate information from different database entities.
- Apollo Client, which is an open source library that enables GraphQL developers to manage information state. Apollo Client provides the infrastructure for caching data.
- Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is designed to ensure the correctness of any JavaScript code base.
- Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React component's output.

# custom-carbon-addons

The `custom-carbon-addons` package is where you must place all of your custom files, to ensure that upgrades do not affect your custom content. 

```
custom-carbon-addons
└───renderers
│   index.js
└───src
    package.json_sample

```

# graphql-mocks

The `graphql-mocks` package is where you can place data for mock graphql queries. This package essentially provides a 
lightweight mock GraphQL service that simulates the real GraphQL service from SPM.

```
graphql-mocks
└───resolvers
│   ─── data
│   index.js
└───typeDefs
└───server.js
    package.json

```
The `typeDefs` directory contains the GraphQL Object Type definitions while the 'resolvers' directory contains the resolver functions (also known as
data fetcher functions in GraphQl parlance) that resolve to data values. The `data` directory is a subset of the resolvers directory and contains the
raw data for the mock GraphQl service.
