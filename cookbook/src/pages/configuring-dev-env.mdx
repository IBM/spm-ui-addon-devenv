description: Configuring your development environment
---

Before you start to work with React components, you must set node environment variables in the `.env` and `.env.development` files.
The `.env` file contains the environment variables for production. The `.env.development` file supersedes the environment variables in `.env` and sets specific environment variables for development.

## Basic configuration

#### GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL

Specifies the relative location for the GraphQL server. For example, the following value sets the full URL for the GrpahQL server to `https://<server>:<port>/Rest/graphql`.
If this value if not set, a default value of `/Rest/grpahql` is used.

```
GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=/Rest/graphql
```

Where `server` is the domain name or IP address of the server and `port` is the port number for the application server.

#### CLIENT_DIR

Specifies the location of the `webclient` directory in the development installation. This value is used to test the integration of components with custom UIM or VIM pages in Social Program Management.

```
CLIENT_DIR=<CLIENT_DIR> 
```

Where `CLIENT_DIR` is the location of the `webclient` directory in the Java development environment.

#### RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE

(Mandatory) Specifies the location of the compiled JavaScript relative to the server.

```
RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE=CDEJ/jscript/SPMUIComponents
```

#### CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME

Specifies the location of the web client component to copy the compiled JavaScript to during deployment. For example:

```
CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME=custom
```

If omitted, the default value 'custom' is used.

## Security Configuration

If you have enabled Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Social Program Management, you must set the following environment variables for production (.env). For more information about CSRF in a React environment, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access).

#### CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT

Specifies the REST endpoint that generates a security token to be sent with each GraphQL HTTP request. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT=/Rest/v1/csrf/tokens
```

#### CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER

Specifies the custom HTTP request header to be sent with each GraphQL request. It is also used to get the security token from the response to the REST endpoint used to generate the token. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER=X-IBM-SPM-CSRF
```
