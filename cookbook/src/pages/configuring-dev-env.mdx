description: Configuring your development environment for Carbon custom widgets
---

Before you start to develop with React components, you must set node environment variables in the `.env` and `.env.development` files.
The `.env` file contains the environment variables for production. The `.env.development` file supersedes the environment variables in `.env` and sets specific environment variables for development.

## Basic configuration

### GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL

Specifies the relative location for the GraphQL server. For example, the following value sets the full URL for the GraphQL server to `https://<server>:<port>/Rest/graphql`.

```
GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL='/Rest/graphql'
```

Where `server` is the domain name or IP address of the server and `port` is the port number for the application server.

You can set a different value in the `.env.development` file, to point a mock server for GraphQL during development.

### DEV_BUNDLE_OUTPUT

(Development only) Specifies the location of the `webclient` directory in the development installation. This value is used to test the integration of the Carbon custom widgets with custom pages (UIM/VIM) in Social Program Management.

```
DEV_BUNDLE_OUTPUT=<CLIENT_DIR> 
```

Where `CLIENT_DIR` is the location of the `webclient` directory in the Java development environment.

### Security Configuration

If you have enabled Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in SPM, you must set the following environment variables for production (.env). For more information about CSRF in a React environment, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access).

### CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT

Specifies the REST endpoint that generates a security token to be sent with each GraphQL HTTP request. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT=/Rest/v1/csrf/tokens
```

### CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER

Specifies the custom HTTP request header to be sent with each GraphQL request. It is also used to get the security token from the response to the REST endpoint used to generate the token. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER=X-IBM-SPM-CSRF
```
