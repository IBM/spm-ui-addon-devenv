description: Configuring your development environment for Carbon custom widgets
---

Before you start to develop Carbon custom widgets, you must set node environment variables in the `.env` and `.env.development` files.
The `.env` file contains the environment variables for production. The `.env.development` file supersedes the environment variables in `.env` and sets specific environment variables for development.

## Basic configuration

### GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL

Specifies the relative location for the GraphQL server. For example, the following value sets the full URL for the GrpahQL server to `https://<server>:<port>/Rest/graphql`.
If this value if not set a default value of '/Rest/grpahql' will be used.

```
GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=/Rest/graphql
```

Where `server` is the domain name or ipaddress of the server and `port` is the port number for the application server.

### CLIENT_DIR

Specifies the location of the `webclient` directory in the development installation. This value is used to test the integration of the Carbon custom widgets with custom pages (UIM/VIM) in SPM. For example:

```
CLIENT_DIR=<CLIENT_DIR> 
```

Where `CLIENT_DIR` is the location of the `webclient` directory in the development installation.

### RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE

Specifies the location of the compiled JavaScript relative to the server. This is only needed if configuring the static content server. For example:

```
RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE=CDEJ/jscript/SPMUIComponents
```
If omiited a default location will be used.

### CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME

Specifies the location of the webclient component that the compiled JavaScript needs to be copied fro deployment. For example:

```
CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME=custom
```

If omiited the default of 'custom' compponent will be used.

### Security Configuration

If you have enabled CSRF protection in SPM, you must set the following environment variables for production (.env). For more information about CSRF in a React environment, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access).

### CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT

Specifies the REST endpoint that generates a security token to be sent with each GraphQL HTTP request. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT=/Rest/v1/csrf/tokens
```

### CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER

Specifies the custom HTTP request header to be sent with each GraphQL request. It is also used to get the security token from the response to the REST endpoint used to generate the token. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER=X-IBM-SPM-CSRF
```
