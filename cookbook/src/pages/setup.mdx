1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). The installation includes the npm (Node package manager), which you can use to install your Node packages.
2. Download and install your IDE. Microsoft Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the recommended IDE. Install any needed extensions, such as ESLint or Prettier.
3. Download the `main` branch of the Cúram UI Addon Development Environment code from [https://github.com/merative/spm-ui-addon-devenv](https://github.com/merative/spm-ui-addon-devenv).

   You can choose one of the following options:

   1. Download as Zip. Select the Code drop-down menu and select the **Download Zip** option.
   2. Open with GitHub Desktop.
   3. Clone the repository. If you have Git set up, you can clone the repository by opening a command prompt and running the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/merative/spm-ui-addon-devenv.git
```

4. Install the Cúram UI Addon Development Environment on your computer by using npm. To install the code, change to the `spm-ui-addon-devenv` directory and run the command:

```
npm ci
```

5. You can now open the repository in your IDE. For example, Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

6. Configure your React development environment variables. Before you start to work with React components, you must set node environment variables in the `.env` file. Update the `.env` file, which sets the environment variables for production builds. For information about the enviroment variables to set in these files, see [Environment variables](environment-variables).
