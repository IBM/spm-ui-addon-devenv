1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). The installation includes the npm (Node package manager), which you can use to install your Node packages.
2. Download and install your IDE. Microsoft Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is the recommended IDE.  Install any needed extensions, such as ESLint or Prettier.
3. Download the `main` branch of the SPM UI Addon Development Environment code from [https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-addon-devenv](https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-addon-devenv).

    You can choose one of the following options:
    1. Download as Zip. Select the Code drop-down menu and select the **Download Zip** option.
    2. Open with GitHub Desktop.
    3. Clone the repository.
    If you have Git set up, you can clone the repository by opening a command prompt and running the command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IBM/spm-ui-addon-devenv.git
    ```

4. Install the SPM UI Addon Development Environment on your computer by using npm. To install the code, change to the `spm-ui-addon-devenv` directory and run the command:

    ```
    npm ci
    ```

5. You can now open the repository in your IDE. For example, Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

6. Configure your React development environment variables. Before you start to work with React components, you must set node environment variables in the `.env` and `.env.development` files.
The `.env` file contains the environment variables for production. The `.env.development` file supersedes the environment variables in `.env` and sets specific environment variables for development.

## Basic configuration

### CLIENT_DIR

Specifies the location of the `webclient` directory in the development installation. This value is used to test the integration of components with custom UIM or VIM pages in Social Program Management.

```
CLIENT_DIR=<CLIENT_DIR> 
```

Where `CLIENT_DIR` is the location of the `webclient` directory in the Java development environment.

### RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE

(Mandatory) Specifies the location of the compiled JavaScript relative to the server.

```
RELATIVE_PATH_TO_BUNDLE=CDEJ/jscript/SPMUIComponents/
```

### CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME

Specifies the location of the web client component to copy the compiled JavaScript to during deployment. For example:

```
CUSTOM_COMPONENT_NAME=custom
```

If omitted, the default value 'custom' is used.

### GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL

Specifies the relative location for the GraphQL server. For example, the following value sets the full URL for the GrpahQL server to `https://<server>:<port>/Rest/graphql`.
If this value if not set, a default value of `/Rest/grpahql` is used.

```
GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=/Rest/graphql
```

Where `server` is the domain name or IP address of the server and `port` is the port number for the application server.

## Security Configuration

If you have enabled Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Social Program Management, you must set the following environment variables for production (.env).
For more information about configuring CSRF in a React environment, see [Enabling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for Universal Access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=sauara-enabling-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection-universal-access).

### CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT

Specifies the REST endpoint that generates a security token to be sent with each GraphQL HTTP request. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_ENPOINT=/Rest/v1/csrf/tokens
```

### CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER

Specifies the custom HTTP request header to be sent with each GraphQL request. It is also used to get the security token from the response to the REST endpoint used to generate the token. Set the following value:

```
CSRF_TOKEN_REQUEST_HEADER=X-IBM-SPM-CSRF
```
