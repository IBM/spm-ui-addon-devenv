This open source repository provides a React JavaScript development environment, which introduces the ability to extend UIM by using the IBM Carbon Design System, React, GraphQL, and Apollo Client.
You can create JavaScript views and integrate them into UIM pages that you create in the Java web client development environment.

## Social Program Management developers can now

* Use a lightweight JavaScript development environment that complements the existing web client development environment.
* Develop complex views with the latest front-end tools and libraries, and integrate them into their Social Program Management web client.
* Develop front-end content quickly and iteratively. JavaScript developers can view their changes without a client build.
* Use GraphQL and Apollo Client to configure complex data queries.
* Build robust front-end content through easier test automation.

## The Social Program Management UI Addon Development Environment provides

* Documentation: Instructions to get up and running in a JavaScript environment, with examples and design guidance.
* Samples: For example, a sample React component that contains IBM Carbon styles and GraphQL queries.
* Storybook: Developers can use Storybook to render the sample component locally.
* Code: Commands to integrate your compiled JavaScript into the Social Program Management user interface.

## The 'spm-ui-addon-devenv' repository contains an 'npm' file for the following packages

* Carbon Design System, which is the IBMÂ  open source design system. It consists of working code, design tools and resources, and human interface guidelines. For more information, see [https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).
* React, which is an open source JavaScript library that enables developers to build human-centered user interfaces.
* GraphQL, which is an open source data query language that enables developers to query and configure complex data queries that aggregate information from different database entities.
* Apollo Client, which is an open source library that enables GraphQL developers to manage information state. Apollo Client provides the infrastructure for caching data.
* Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is designed to ensure the correctness of any JavaScript code base.
* Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React component's output.
