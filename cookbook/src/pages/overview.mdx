This open source repository provides a React JavaScript development environment, which introduces the ability to extend UIM by using the IBM Carbon Design System, React, GraphQL, and Apollo Client.
You can create JavaScript views and integrate them into UIM pages that you create in the Java web client development environment.

Social Program Management developers can:

* Use a lightweight JavaScript development environment that complements the existing web client development environment.
* Develop complex views with the latest front-end tools and libraries, and integrate them into their Social Program Management web client.
* Develop front-end content quickly and iteratively. JavaScript developers can view their changes without a client build.
* Use GraphQL and Apollo Client to configure complex data queries.
* Build robust front-end content through easier test automation.

* Code: Commands to integrate your compiled JavaScript into the Social Program Management user interface.
* Samples: For example, a sample React component that contains IBM Carbon styles and GraphQL queries.
* Storybook: Developers can use Storybook to render the sample component locally.
