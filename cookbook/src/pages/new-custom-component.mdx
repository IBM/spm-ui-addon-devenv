title: Creating a custom Carbon add-on component
description: Creating a custom Carbon add-on component
---

This procedure assumes that you are already familiar with the design guidance from Carbon Design System and IBM Social Program Management.

The repository consists of two packages: 

- The `carbon-addon-devenv` package contains the development environment to work with Carbon components and 
to develop custom Carbon add-on components.
It contains two sample add-on components to help you to get started, which need a Java renderer and a GraphQL query to integrate them onto a UIM page.
- The `custom-carbon-addons` package is where you must place all of your custom files, to ensure that upgrades do not affect your custom content.

The following procedure creates a Carbon add-on component, called `addonX`, and integrates it onto a custom UIM page. The steps do not necessarily need to be done in this order, but this is currently the recommended order.

1. Implement a GraphQL query.
   The GraphQL query provides the data access between the service layer with the business logic for a new feature and the UI components on a custom page that presents the data to the user.
   For more information about how to implement a GraphQL query, seeÂ [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=apis-graphql).
   GraphQL queries can be large and used to serve data for many carbon addons, or they can be more granular where they are used for a 
   specific addon, such as addonX.

2. Implement the custom component in React by completing the following steps:

    - Create a directory in the `react/addons` directory. For example, `addonX`.
    - Add the JavaScript files to the directory. Import Carbon components from the `carbon-components` node module 
      when you need to compose new add-on components based on Carbon components.
    - Unit tests can be done in parallel to test the generated HTML output from the implemented component.

3. Implement the look and feel of the component with Sass. Ensure that you follow the design guidance of 
   both Carbon and Social Program Management.

    - In the `scss` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` directory, create an SCSS file for the component and 
      import it into the `index.scss` file. For example, `addonX.scss`.

4. Test the component in Storybook.
    Ensure that your components meet the business requirements by testing them in isolation before they are integrated into Social Program Management.
    - In the `stories` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package, add a separate directory for each carbon component.

5. Implement a query provider in Apollo Client.
    An Apollo Client query provider enables the cached data from GraphQL to be integrated with `addonX` implemented in React.
    Complete the following steps:
    - Create a directory in the `apollo-client/hooks` directory. For example, `addonX`.
    - If you don't already have a large GraphQL query that serves a number of components, create a query that 
      accesses the data from the back-end by importing `gql` and `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`.

6. Implement a Renderer function.
    This is not necessarily needed, but is a convenience helper function to integrate an addon into a Java Renderer on a UIM page.
    There is a `renderers` directory available in the `custom-carbon-addon` package that can be used to create renderer functions.
    There is also a helper function available called `Renderer.create()` to create a renderer function that can be used 
    on a Java Renderer to integrate the addon into UIM.
