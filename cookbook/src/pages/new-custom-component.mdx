title: Adding a custom Carbon addon component
description: Adding a custom Carbon addon component
---

This procedure assumes that you are already familiar with the design guidance from Carbon Design System and IBM Social Program Management.

The repository consists of 2 packages. The <b>carbon-addon-devenv</b> package contains the development environment for the development of custom Carbon addons.
It contains two sample components to help you to get started, which just need a Java renderer and a GraphQL query to integrate them.
The `custom-carbon-addons` package is where you must place all of your custom files, to ensure that upgrades do not affect your custom content.

The following procedure creates a Carbon component, called addonX, and integrates it onto a custom UIM page. The steps do not necessarily need to be done in this order, but this is currently the recommended order.

1. Implement a GraphQL query.
    The GraphQL query provides the data access between the service layer with the business logic for a new feature and the UI components on a custom page that presents the data to the user.
    For more information about how to implement a GraphQL query, seeÂ [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=apis-graphql).
    GraphQL queries can be large and used to serve data for many carbon addons, or they can be more granular where they are used for a specific addon, such as addonX.

2. Implement the carbon addon in React.
    Complete the following steps:

    * Create a new directory in the react/addons directory. For example, `addonX`.
    * Add the JavaScript files to the directory. Import addons from the `carbon-components` node module where you need to compose new components based on Carbon components.
    * Unit tests can be done in parallel to test the generated HTML output from the implemented addon.

3. Implement the look and feel of the addon in Sass.
    When implementing the look and feel in Sass, it is important to follow the design guidance of both Carbon and Social Program Management.

    Complete the following steps:

    * Within the scss directory of the custom-carbon-addon directory, create a new Sass file for this addonand import it into the index.scss file. For example, `addonX.scss`.

4. Test the addon in Storybook.
    Ensure that your components meet the business requirements by testing them in isolation before it is integrated into Social Program Management.
    Complete the following steps:
    In the stories directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package, add a seperate directory for each carbon component.

5. Implement a query provider in Apollo Client.
    An Apollo Client query provider enables the cached data from GraphQL to be integrated with <b>addonX</b> implemented in React.
    Complete the following steps:
    * Create a new directory in the `apollo-client/hooks` directory. For example, `addonX`.
    * Create a query that accesses the data from the backend by importing `gql` and `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`. This is not necessary if a query is being done to serve several addons.

6. Implement a Renderer function.
    This is not necessarily needed, but is a convenience helper function to integrate an addon into a Java Renderer on a UIM page.
    There is a `renderers` directory available in the `custom-carbon-addon` package that can be used to create renderer functions.
    There is also a helper function available called `Renderer.create()` to create a renderer function that can be used on a Java Renderer to integrate the addon into UIM.
