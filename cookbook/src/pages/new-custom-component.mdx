When creating a custom Carbon component there is a series of steps you will need to undertake before it can be integrated into a custom UIM page. To create a Carbon add-on component called `componentX`, the following steps would need to be done. 
They do not necessarily need to be done in this order, but this is currently the recommended order.

### (1) Implement a custom React JavaScript component by completing the following steps
  - In the 'custom-carbon-addons' package, create a directory for the component in the `react` directory. For example, `custom-carbon-addons/react/addons/componentX`.
  - Create the JavaScript files for `componentX` in the directory. To create add-on components that are based on Carbon components, import the Carbon components from the `carbon-components` node module.
  - You can do your unit tests in parallel to test the generated HTML output from the component.

### (2) Implement the look and feel of the component with Sass 
Ensure that you follow the Carbon and Social Program Management design guidance.

  - In the `custom-carbon-addon/scss` directory, create an SCSS file for the component. For example, `componentX.scss`.
  - Import 'ComponentX.scss' into the `index.scss` file.

### (3) Implement a query provider in Apollo Client 
 An Apollo Client query provider enables the cached data from GraphQL to be integrated with a React component.
    Complete the following steps:

  - Create a directory in the `custom-carbon-addon/apollo-client-hooks/hooks` directory. For example, `componentX`. There are several helper
      React components available from the `carbon-addons-devenv` package to help with this task: ApolloClientDataProvider, ApolloClientQueryProvider, and
      ApolloClientHookTemplate.
  - Create a query that accesses data from the back-end by importing `gql` and `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`. If you already have a GraphQL query that serves a number of components, you can use that query.

### (4) Test the Carbon component in Storybook 
To test `componentX` in storybook, you can test components in isolation before you integrate them into Social Program Management.

  - In the `stories` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package, create a directory for the component. For example, `custom-carbon-addon/stories/componentX`. Run `npm run storybook/` to test components.

### (5) Create a JavaScript renderer function
You can use the `Renderer.create()` helper function to implement a JavaScript Renderer function to integrate the component into a Java Renderer on the UIM page. You can place your renderer functions in the `custom-carbon-addon/renderers` directory. For example, create the`CarbonComponentXViewRenderer` function.
