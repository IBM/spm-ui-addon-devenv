This procedure assumes that you are already familiar with the design guidance from Carbon Design System and IBM Social Program Management.

Complete the following steps to create a Carbon add-on component called `componentX` and integrate it onto a custom UIM page. The steps do not necessarily need to be done in this order, but this is currently the recommended order.

1. Implement a custom React JavaScript component by completing the following steps:
    - In the `custom-carbon-addons` package, create a directory for the component in the `react` directory. For example, `custom-carbon-addons/react/addons/componentX`.
    - Create the JavaScript files for `componentX` in the directory. To create add-on components that are based on Carbon components, import the Carbon components from the `carbon-components` node module.
    - You can do your unit tests in parallel to test the generated HTML output from the component.

3. Implement the look and feel of the component with Sass. Ensure that you follow the Carbon and Social Program Management design guidance.

    - In the `custom-carbon-addon/scss` directory, create an SCSS file for the component. For example, `componentX.scss`.
    - Import `ComponentX.scss` into the `index.scss` file. 

4. Implement a query provider in Apollo Client.
    An Apollo Client query provider enables the cached data from GraphQL to be integrated with a React component.
    Complete the following steps:
    - Create a directory in the `custom-carbon-addon/apollo-client-hooks/hooks` directory. For example, `componentX`. There are several helper
      React components available from the `carbon-addons-devenv` package to help with this task: ApolloClientDataProvider, ApolloClientQueryProvider, and
      ApolloClientHookTemplate.
    - Create a query that accesses data from the back-end by importing `gql` and `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`. If you already have a GraphQL query that serves a number of components, you can use that query.

5. Test the `componentX` component in Storybook. You can test components in isolation before you integrate them into Social Program Management.
    - In the `stories` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package, create a directory for the component. For example, `custom-carbon-addon/stories/componentX`. Run `npm run storybook/` to test components.

6. Use the `Renderer.create()` helper function to implement a JavaScript Renderer function to integrate the component into a Java Renderer on the UIM page. You can place your renderer functions in the `custom-carbon-addon/renderers` directory.
