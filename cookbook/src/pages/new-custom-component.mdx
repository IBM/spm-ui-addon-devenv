title: Creating a custom Carbon add-on component
description: Creating a custom Carbon add-on component
---

This procedure assumes that you are already familiar with the design guidance from Carbon Design System and IBM Social Program Management.


Complete the following steps to create a Carbon add-on component, called `addonX`, and integrate it onto a custom UIM page. The steps do not necessarily need to be done in this order, but this is currently the recommended order.

1. Implement a custom component in React by completing the following steps:

    - In the `custom-carbon-addons` package, create a directory structure for the component in the `react` directory. For example, `react/addons/addonX`.
    - Add the JavaScript files to the directory. Import Carbon components from the `carbon-components` node module
      when you need to compose new add-on components based on Carbon components.
    - Unit tests can be done in parallel to test the generated HTML output from the implemented component.

3. Implement the look and feel of the component with Sass. Ensure that you follow the design guidance of both Carbon and Social Program Management.

    - In the `scss` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` directory, create an SCSS file for the component and
      import it into the `index.scss` file. For example, `addonX.scss`.

4. Test the component in Storybook by running `npm run storybook`.
    Ensure that your components meet the business requirements by testing them in isolation before they are integrated into Social Program Management.
    - In the `stories` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package, add a separate directory for each carbon component.

5. Implement a query provider in Apollo Client.
    An Apollo Client query provider enables the cached data from GraphQL to be integrated with `addonX` implemented in React.
    Complete the following steps:
    - Create a directory in the `apollo-client/hooks` directory. For example, `addonX`.
    - If you don't already have a large GraphQL query that serves a number of components, create a query that
      accesses the data from the back-end by importing `gql` and `useQuery` from `@apollo/client`.

6. Implement a JavaScript Renderer function.
    This is not necessarily needed, but is a convenience helper function to integrate an addon into a Java Renderer on a UIM page.
    You can place your renderer functions in the `renderers` directory of the `custom-carbon-addon` package.
    There is also a helper function available called `Renderer.create()` to create a renderer function that can be used
    on a Java Renderer to integrate the addon into UIM.
