To get you started, see how you can implement a custom page that contains a Carbon component called `componentX`, and how to set up a GraphQL mock service to test your component with mock data.
Refer to the provided samples in the code for guidance as you develop your new component.

In general, you must complete the following tasks to create custom pages:

In your JavaScript development environment:

- Create a custom React JavaScript component and style it with Sass.
- Implement a query provider in Apollo Client for GraphQL data.
- Test the Carbon component in Storybook.
- Create a JavaScript renderer helper function for a Java renderer.
- If you want to use the mock GraphQL service, add mock data for your component.

In your web client development environment:

- Create a custom UIM page.
- Create and configure a Java renderer.

In your server development environment:

- Create a domain definition for your custom component.
- Implement a GraphQL query to provide data to your custom component. If you use the mock GraphQL service, you can test your component before you implement a GraphQL query.
