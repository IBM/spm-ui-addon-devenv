After the code is installed and configured, the following commands are available:

```
npm run build
```

This command builds the deliverable artefacts from the installed codebase.

```
npm run dev
```

This command tests the integration with Social Program Management. It requires the `CLIENT_DIR` environment variable to be set.
It copies the generated artefects from `npm run build` to the location where they can be picked up by Social Program Management.
Any JavaScript or SCSS files that are updated are automatically generated when integrated with Social Program Management.

```
export GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql && npm run dev-with-mockgraphql
```

This command is the same as the `npm run dev` command, but prioritizes the data from the mock GraphQL service over the real REST Service when running in SPM. The command requires the same environmental setup as the npm run dev command.

```
npm run test
```

This command runs the JavaScript unit tests for React components that you have created. Some sample tests are provided in the code base.

```
npm run coverage
```

This command generates a report on JavaScript code coverage. There is certain threshold that is specified for code coverage. If coverage falls below this level the report fails to be generated.

```
npm run gen-doc
```

This command generates the documentation for React components that are being developed. It is based on JSDoc, see [https://jsdoc.app/](https://jsdoc.app/).

```
npm run lint
```

This command enforces coding best practices for React components in JavaScript and SCSS.

```
npm run storybook
```

This command starts Storybook and show how to use the components with examples.

```
npm run deploy
```

This command copies the compiled JavaScript to the specified web client custom component for deployment.
