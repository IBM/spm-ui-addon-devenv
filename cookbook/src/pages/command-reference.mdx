After the code is installed and configured, the following commands are available:

```
npm run build
```

This command builds the deliverable artefacts from the installed codebase. For more information, see [Building during development](build).

```
npm run dev
```

This command tests the integration with Cúram. It requires the `CLIENT_DIR` environment variable to be set.
It copies the generated artefects from `npm run build` to the location where they can be picked up by Cúram.
After you run the command, any JavaScript or SCSS files that are updated are automatically generated. For more information, see [Building during development](build).

```
export GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql && npm run dev-with-mockgraphql
```

This command is the same as the `npm run dev` command, but prioritizes the data from the mock GraphQL service over the real REST Service when running in Cúram. It requires the `CLIENT_DIR` environment variable to be set.

```
npm run test
```

This command runs the JavaScript unit tests for React components that you have created. Some sample tests are provided in the code base for guidance.

```
npm run coverage
```

This command generates a report on JavaScript code coverage. If coverage falls below a certain threshold that is specified for code coverage the report fails to be generated.

```
npm run gen-doc
```

This command generates the documentation for React components that are being developed. It is based on JSDoc, see [https://jsdoc.app/](https://jsdoc.app/).

```
npm run lint
```

This command enforces coding best practices for React components in JavaScript and SCSS.

```
npm run analyze-bundle
```

This command generates a HTML report (reports/bundle-size.html) that shows a breakdown of each generated JavaScript file in terms
of how much footprint (size in KB) each third-party library contributes to their overall size.

```
npm run storybook
```

This command starts Storybook, which shows how to use the components with examples.

```
npm run deploy
```

This command copies the compiled JavaScript to the specified web client custom component for deployment. For more information, see [Deploying components](deployment).
