A GraphQL query provides the data access between the service layer with the business logic for a new feature and the UI components on a custom page that presents the data to the user.

GraphQL queries can be large and used to serve data for many components, or they can be more granular where they are used for a specific component, such as `componentX`.

For more information about how to implement a GraphQL query, seeÂ [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql).
