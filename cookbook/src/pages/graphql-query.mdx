A GraphQL query provides the data access between the service layer with the business logic for a new feature and the UI components on a custom page that presents the data to the user.

GraphQL queries can be large and used to serve data for many components, or they can be more granular where they are used for a specific component, such as `componentX`.

For more information about how to implement a GraphQL query, seeÂ [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql).

### Mock GraphQL service
While the REST Service provides the real data from the GraphQL queries in SPM, there is a lightweight mock GraphQL service that you can use to enable rapid development almost exclusively on this front-end environment. For example, if you want to develop your Carbon components before the real GraphQL queries are available in Social Program Management, you can use the mock GraphQL service with Carbon components either on Storybook or testing the integration with SPM or both.

To add mock data to the mock GraphQL service, complete the following steps:
 - In the `typeDefs` directory, add a new GraphQL query type definition and add it to the `index.js` file in that directory to export it.
 - In the `resolvers` directory, add a new resolver and export in the `index.js` within that directory to export it.
 - Add the data to the `data` subdirectory of `resolvers` and import the data in your new resolver.

 You can refer to the provided examples for guidance.
