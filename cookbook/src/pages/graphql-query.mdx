A GraphQL query provides the data access between the service layer with the business logic for a new feature and the UI components on a custom page that presents the data to the user.

GraphQL queries can be large and used to serve data for many components, or they can be more granular where they are used for a specific component, such as `componentX`.

For more information about how to implement a GraphQL query, seeÂ [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=apis-graphql).

### Mock GraphQL service
While the REST Service provides the real data from the GraphQL queries in SPM, there is a lightweight mock GraphQL service that can be
used to enable rapid development almost exclusively on this front end environment. For example if you wanted to develop your Carbon components
first before the real GraphQL queries are available within SPM, you could use the mock GraphQL service with Carbon components either on storybook
or testing the integration with SPM or both.

To add mock data to the mock GraphQL service, the following steps needs to be done :
 - In the `typeDefs` directory add a new GraphQL query type definition and add it to the index.js within that directory to export it.
 - In the `resolvers` directory add a new resolver and export is in the index.js within that directory to export it.
 - Add the data to the `data` subdirectory of resolvers and import the data in your new resolver.

 Note that there already examples here which can be used as a reference.
