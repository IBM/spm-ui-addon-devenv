Build your components in your development environment during development. For more information about commands and command configuration, see the [Command reference](command-reference).

1. Build your component. Ideally, run this command each time you add new files to the repository.

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Run a development build to integrate the component with the web client application. Any updates you make to existing files while the development build is running are reflected in the application.

   If you don't use the GraphQL mock service, use this command to run the development build. The GraphQL data from the REST Service is used.

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   If you use the GraphQL mock service, use this command to run the development build. The command is the same as the `npm run dev` command, but prioritizes the data from the mock GraphQL service over the real REST Service when running in CÃºram.

   ```
   export GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql && npm run dev-with-mockgraphql
   ```
