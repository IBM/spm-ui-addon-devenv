Build your components during development. For more information about commands, see the [Command reference](command-reference). 
 
1. Build your component.

   ``` 
   npm run build
   ```
2. Run a development build to integrate the component with the web client application. Any changes you make while the development build is running are reflected in the application.

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
