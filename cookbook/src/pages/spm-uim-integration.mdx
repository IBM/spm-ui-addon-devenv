When your component is developed and adequately tested, you can integrate it with Social Program Management. The supported method of rendering Carbon components on a UIM page is by using a Java renderer.

A custom UIM page with a configured Java renderer is needed to host a Carbon component so that it can be integrated and displayed to the user.

Complete two basic steps to integrate the component into a Java renderer:

1. Create a custom UIM page.
2. Configure a Java renderer by doing the following:
  - Create a new domain definition in your custom component in the EJBServer directory. For more information about configuring domain definitions see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=renderers-configuring-domain](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=renderers-configuring-domain).
  - Update the DomainsConfig.xml in your custom component in the webclient directory to map the new domain definition to a new Java renderer. If this file does not already
    exist in your custom component you will need to create one. The following example snippet assumes you have created a new domain definition called
    `CUSTOM_CARBON_COMPONENT_X`.
    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <dc:domains xmlns:dc="http://www.curamsoftware.com/curam/util/common/domain-config">
      <dc:domain name="CUSTOM_CARBON_COMPONENT_X">
       <dc:plug-in name="view-renderer"
                class="custom.CarbonComponentXViewRenderer"/>
      </dc:domain>
    </dc:domains>
    ```
  - Create the Java renderer. In this example you would create the Java Rendrerer CarbonComponentXViewRenderer.java
    in the sub directory JavaSource/custom of the custom component of the webclient directory. This renderer should extend the
    AbstractViewRenderer (curam.util.client.domain.render.view.AbstractViewRenderer) class.

3. In the renderer, create a HTML element to host the output from the Carbon component. This HTML element must have the `spm-custom-component` CSS class name. For example,

    ```
    <div id="<someId>" class="spm-custom-component"> 
    ```

4. Make a call to the `includeCarbonComponent()` function in the this new renderer to enable the integration of the component. For more information, see the the Java documentation.

Assuming we have a JavaScript function already as ComponentXRenderer, then the following code would be called from the render() method
of the CarbonComponentXViewRenderer file.

```
// labels to be used to pass translated labels into the carbon component.
final String labels = "{}";
// the id of the HTML element on the renderer that will host the HTML content from the Carbon component
final String carbonWrapperDivID = "ComponentX";
// map can be used for extra configuration that may be needed, such as passing argument to GraphQL queries
final Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
```

```
// making the call to integrate the ComponentX component into the renderer via
// the ComponentXRenderer JavaScript renderer function
includeCarbonComponent(context, carbonWrapperDivID, labels, "{}",
      "window.spmcustom.renderers.ComponentX.ComponentXRenderer",
      map);
```
