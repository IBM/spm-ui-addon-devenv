When your component is developed and adequately tested, you can integrate it with Social Program Management. The supported method of rendering Carbon components on a UIM page is by using a Java renderer.

A custom UIM page with a configured Java renderer is needed to host a Carbon component so that it can be integrated and displayed to the user.

Complete two basic steps to integrate the component into a Java renderer:

1. Create a custom UIM page.
2. Configure a Java renderer. For more information about configuring renderers, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=widgets-configuring-renderers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=widgets-configuring-renderers).
3. In the renderer, create a HTML element to host the output from the Carbon component. This HTML element must have the `spm-custom-component` CSS class name. For example,

    ```
    <div id="<someId>" class="spm-custom-component"> 
    ```

4. Make a call to the `includeCarbonComponent()` function in the Java renderer framework to enable the integration of the component. For more information, see the the Java documentation.

An example of integrating the sample Person Folio component into a domain Java renderer on a UIM page is shown.
Note that `"sampleRenderers"` is used, but for a real custom example, you would use "renderers" instead.

```
// labels to be used within the Person Folio compoonent. Hardcoding to English here as this is for demo and no concerned with globalaization
final String labels =
      "{firstnameLabel: 'First name', surnameLabel: 'Surname', ageLabel: 'Age'}";
// the id of the HTML element on the renderer that will host the HTML content from the Carbon component
final String hostElementID = "PersonFolio";
// extra configuration here needed. The logoId needed as a varibable to be passed into the query to retrieve a //logo
final Map<String, String> extraConfig = new HashMap<String, String>();
    map.put("logoId", String.valueOf(logoID));
```

```
// making the call to integrate the PersonFolio component into the renderer using the 
// PersonFolioRenderer helper function
includeCarbonComponent(context, hostElementID, labels, "{}",
      "window.spmcustom.sampleRenderers.PersonFolio.PersonFolioRenderer",
      map);
```

In this example, labels were hard-coded as globalization is not a concern.
However, for properly translated labels, you must put them into a `*.properties` file and look them up using the `context.getDataAccessor()` function.
