There are many IDEs that you can choose, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime. However, Cúram uses Microsoft Visual Studio Code to develop Cúram UI Addons. It supports many plugins that make development faster and easier. For example, it supports the following tools:\n\n- Linting tools (ESLint)\n- Code formatters (Prettier)\n- Debugging tools (Debugger for Chrome)\n- Documentation tools (JSDoc)\n\nCúram does not own, develop, or support these tools.\n\nThe repository includes some basic configuration for Microsoft Visual Studio Code and you can download more plug ins as necessary.
